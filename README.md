# Style Transfer With Keras

### If any one is interested create a django app and host it on heroku.

[This notebook is also hosted as a webpage here](https://anand0427.github.io/style-transfer-with-keras/index.html)

#### I used VGG16. And the conv layers chosen are clearly displayed in the notebook.

### This is for my practice and my sources and credits to [Harish Narayan](https://harishnarayanan.org/writing/artistic-style-transfer/) and also the [keras documentation](https://keras.io/examples/neural_style_transfer/) which is as elaborate as can be.
